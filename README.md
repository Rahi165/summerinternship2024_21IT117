* Learning new skills

## 📝 Day-by-Day Progress
### Day 1: Learning about the technologies being used
- On the first day, the primary task was to delve into the K-means clustering algorithm for customer segmentation. This involved several key activities aimed at laying the groundwork for effective customer segmentation.
- Studying Core Principles and Centroid Initialization:
I began by studying the core principles of the K-means clustering algorithm, focusing on how it partitions data into distinct groups based on feature similarity. Additionally, I explored the significance of centroid initialization and its impact on the algorithm's performance, ensuring a clear understanding of potential challenges and solutions.
- Familiarizing with Python and Data Science Libraries:
The next step was to familiarize ourselves with Python, with a particular focus on data science libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, and Scikit-learn. I reviewed the documentation and tutorials for these libraries to understand their functionalities and how they can be leveraged for data manipulation and machine learning tasks.

### Day 2: Learning the technologies
- Implementing K-means Clustering:
I wrote Python code to implement the K-means clustering algorithm from scratch to gain a deep understanding of its inner workings. Additionally, I utilized Scikit-learn's built-in K-means clustering function for efficient and optimized clustering, comparing our implementation with the library's optimized version.
- Data Preprocessing Techniques:
I learned techniques for data normalization and scaling to ensure that features contribute equally to the clustering process. I also focused on handling missing data and outliers, understanding their importance in improving clustering performance and ensuring the reliability of the results.

### Day 3: Compeleting simple tasks for project based learning
- Applying K-means clustering to real-world data requires a hands-on approach. Initial tasks include performing exploratory data analysis (EDA) to uncover patterns in customer purchase history and using visualization tools like Matplotlib and Seaborn to create informative plots. These steps help in understanding the data distribution and relationships, which are vital for effective clustering.
- Implementing K-means clustering on a subset of the data allows for iterative improvement and fine-tuning of the process. Evaluating the clustering results using metrics like the silhouette score and within-cluster sum of squares (WCSS) helps in assessing the quality of the clusters.

### Day 4: Learning new skills
- Feature engineering is a crucial aspect of improving the clustering results. Creating new features from the raw data can provide additional insights and enhance the clustering quality. Experimenting with different feature combinations can lead to more meaningful customer segments. Furthermore, analyzing and interpreting the formed clusters is essential to understand the characteristics of each segment.
- This analysis can inform business strategies, such as targeted marketing and personalized offers, making the clustering results actionable and valuable for the organization.

## 📝 Day-by-Day Progress
### Day 1: Learning about the technologies being used
- Understanding Support Vector Machines (SVM):
Study the fundamental principles of SVM, including how it classifies data by finding the optimal separating hyperplane. Explore the kernel trick and its role in transforming non-linearly separable data into higher dimensions where a linear separation is possible.
- Familiarizing with Image Data and Preprocessing:
Learn about common image preprocessing techniques such as resizing, normalization, and augmentation to prepare images for machine learning models. Understand the characteristics and challenges of working with image data, including varying image sizes and the need for consistent preprocessing.

### Day 2: Acquiring technology knowledge
- Implementing SVM for Image Classification:
Write Python code to implement an SVM classifier using libraries like Scikit-learn, focusing on understanding the SVM parameters and their impact on classification performance. Experiment with different kernels (linear, polynomial, RBF) to observe their effects on the classifier’s ability to distinguish between images of cats and dogs.
- Image Feature Extraction:
Learn techniques for extracting meaningful features from images, such as Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG), color histograms, and pixel intensity values. Understand how to convert images into feature vectors that can be fed into the SVM for training and classification.

### Day 3: Finishing moderate assignments for project-based learning 
- Dataset Exploration and Preparation:
Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the Kaggle dataset to understand its structure, distribution, and any potential issues that need addressing. Split the dataset into training, validation, and test sets, ensuring a balanced distribution of classes across each set.
- Initial Model Training and Evaluation:
Train the SVM classifier on a subset of the dataset to quickly assess its performance and make necessary adjustments. Evaluate the initial model using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to identify areas for improvement and optimize the model.

### Day 4: Obtaining new skills
- Hyperparameter Tuning:
Learn techniques for hyperparameter tuning, such as grid search and random search, to find the optimal SVM parameters that enhance classification accuracy. Understand the trade-offs between different hyperparameters and how they affect the model’s generalization ability.
- Model Validation and Cross-Validation:
Implement cross-validation techniques to assess the model’s performance on different subsets of the data, ensuring robustness and preventing overfitting. Analyze cross-validation results to identify the best performing model and validate its performance on the test set.
