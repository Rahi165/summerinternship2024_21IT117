## üìù Day-by-Day Progress
### Day 1: Getting awareness of the technologies in use
- Understanding Linear Regression: Linear regression is a fundamental statistical technique used to model the relationship between a dependent variable (house prices) and one or more independent variables (such as square footage, number of bedrooms, and number of bathrooms). It assumes a linear relationship between the predictor variables and the target variable.
  
### Day 2: Obtaining expertise of the technologies 
- Python and Libraries: Familiarization with Python is essential for implementing the linear regression model. Python offers powerful libraries like NumPy for numerical operations, Pandas for data manipulation, and Scikit-learn for implementing machine learning algorithms, including linear regression.
- Implementing the linear regression model involves writing Python code to fit the model to training data, where the model learns the relationship between the independent variables (square footage, bedrooms, bathrooms) and the dependent variable (house prices). This process includes:
-- Data preparation: Gathering and cleaning data, handling missing values, and ensuring data quality. Feature selection, Model training, Model evaluation.
  
### Day 3: Performing uncomplicated tasks for project-based 
- Data Collection and Preprocessing:
Gathering a dataset that includes information on house prices, square footage, bedrooms, and bathrooms from reliable sources or datasets like those available on platforms such as Kaggle.
- Preprocessing the data involves cleaning, transforming, and normalizing the data to ensure that it is suitable for training the linear regression model. Techniques such as feature scaling (if necessary) and handling categorical variables (if applicable) may also be considered.
- Model Development and Validation: Developing the linear regression model involves splitting the dataset into training and test sets to train the model on one set and validate it on another. Validating the model's performance through techniques like cross-validation to ensure that it generalizes well to unseen data and does not overfit.
  
### Day 4: Developing fresh skills
- Enhancing Model Performance:
Learning techniques for improving the linear regression model's performance, such as regularization (e.g., Ridge or Lasso regression) to prevent overfitting and improve prediction accuracy.
- Exploring advanced topics like feature engineering to create new features that may enhance the model's predictive power.
  
## WEEK 2
### 23th May 2024
- Orientation Meeting: Task 2 is given
- Create a K-means clustering algorithm to group customers of a retail store based on their purchase history.
- Dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vjchoudhary7/customer-segmentation-tutorial-in-python 

### Here is the Outline of Week-2:
* Learning about the technologies being used
* Learning the technologies
* Compeleting simple tasks for project based learning
* Learning new skills

## üìù Day-by-Day Progress
### Day 1: Learning about the technologies being used
- On the first day, the primary task was to delve into the K-means clustering algorithm for customer segmentation. This involved several key activities aimed at laying the groundwork for effective customer segmentation.
- Studying Core Principles and Centroid Initialization:
I began by studying the core principles of the K-means clustering algorithm, focusing on how it partitions data into distinct groups based on feature similarity. Additionally, I explored the significance of centroid initialization and its impact on the algorithm's performance, ensuring a clear understanding of potential challenges and solutions.
- Familiarizing with Python and Data Science Libraries:
The next step was to familiarize ourselves with Python, with a particular focus on data science libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, and Scikit-learn. I reviewed the documentation and tutorials for these libraries to understand their functionalities and how they can be leveraged for data manipulation and machine learning tasks.

### Day 2: Learning the technologies
- Implementing K-means Clustering:
I wrote Python code to implement the K-means clustering algorithm from scratch to gain a deep understanding of its inner workings. Additionally, I utilized Scikit-learn's built-in K-means clustering function for efficient and optimized clustering, comparing our implementation with the library's optimized version.
- Data Preprocessing Techniques:
I learned techniques for data normalization and scaling to ensure that features contribute equally to the clustering process. I also focused on handling missing data and outliers, understanding their importance in improving clustering performance and ensuring the reliability of the results.

### Day 3: Compeleting simple tasks for project based learning
- Applying K-means clustering to real-world data requires a hands-on approach. Initial tasks include performing exploratory data analysis (EDA) to uncover patterns in customer purchase history and using visualization tools like Matplotlib and Seaborn to create informative plots. These steps help in understanding the data distribution and relationships, which are vital for effective clustering.
- Implementing K-means clustering on a subset of the data allows for iterative improvement and fine-tuning of the process. Evaluating the clustering results using metrics like the silhouette score and within-cluster sum of squares (WCSS) helps in assessing the quality of the clusters.

### Day 4: Learning new skills
- Feature engineering is a crucial aspect of improving the clustering results. Creating new features from the raw data can provide additional insights and enhance the clustering quality. Experimenting with different feature combinations can lead to more meaningful customer segments. Furthermore, analyzing and interpreting the formed clusters is essential to understand the characteristics of each segment.
- This analysis can inform business strategies, such as targeted marketing and personalized offers, making the clustering results actionable and valuable for the organization.
